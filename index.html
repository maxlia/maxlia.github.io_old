                <p> My name is Chuang Liang Xu. I am a student living in New York, NY. I moved to New York for my college education. Here, I realize that to pursue the dream of my life, only passion is not enough. And here, I am searching for the way to express my feelings and ideas.</p>
                <p>Art and design are always my interest, and the reason why I come to the New York is that it contains various culture and art. I will have chance to experience different culture and art.</p>
                <p>I spend most of my time in front of a computer for designing, researching, and playing. Painting and drawing are also filling with my time. I also like to hand out with friends, and traveling is my favorite even though I have not been to lots places.</p>
